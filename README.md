# Robot Programming midterms: ROBOT SIMULATION IN ENVIRONMENT

This repository contains the two midterm projects developed and handed over for evaluation (both marked as PASSED) during the pursuing of the Robot Programming Course 2025 (3 ECTS) as part of the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Master's Degree at "La Sapienza" University of Rome.

## The Task
A remote controlled robot is placed in an environmnet (a building) and is deployed with a laser scanner (long range, front view) and a Landmark Scanner (short range, proximity sensor). The task consists in implementing the robot that acts coherently to the situation in a ROS developing environmnet. The envirotnment can be run also with multiple agents deployed. 

For more information about each midterm, please visit [Midterm A](https://github.com/alecrespi/sapienza-robotprogramming-midterms/midterm-a/README.md) and [Midterm B](https://github.com/alecrespi/sapienza-robotprogramming-midterms/midterm-b/README.md).

## Knowledge involved
